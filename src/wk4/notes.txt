A factory method is a method that creates an object
of that class as its starting point => pre-set config


Fun Example 1: Fighting Game

In wk3, we already created a Player class
A class named FightingGame
    name                        String
    list of players             array
    gameOver                    boolean
    turn                        int

constructor     two Player objects
                name, 2 players
toString()        summarizes the fight name and 2 players
fight()
        randomly select one of the players to attack the other
        continue until one of the players is no longer alive

        use Random method    nextInt(1)
                determine player to be attacker
isGameOver()
        determine if one of the players is no longer alive
        output who defeated who



Fun Example 2

create a class named GoTrain
instance variables
    baseFare        4.0
    list of Barrie Line stations
    departingStation: String: where you start your trip from
    destinationStation: String: where you end your trip
    prestoCardBalance: double value

constructor(double balance)
            set prestoCardBalance to balance value

tapOn(String station)
        determine if station exists (is found in) your list of Barrie Line stations
            inner methods to accomplish this
                if yes, add this station value to departingStation
                    subtract the baseFare from balance
                if no, sout  error message

tapOff(String station)
        determine if station exists (is found in) your list of Barrie Line stations
            inner methods to accomplish this
                if yes, add this station value to destinationStation
                    take the absolute value of the difference between
                    the starting station index and ending station index
                    multiply this by baseFare
                    subtract this value from prestoCard balance
                    call on method tripTotal
                if no, sout  error message
tripTotal
    summarize the starting station, ending station, total cost of trip, balance remaining on presto card
