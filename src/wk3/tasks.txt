Task 1:
    Add a new constructor that allows user to
    add a minNumber amount and a maxnumber

    When user attempts to set Operand1 or 2
    enforce the operand value to only
    allow values between min and max

Task 2:
    Add a new constructor that accepts an array of chars
    will only allow user to answer those operators

    When user attempts to set operator, only accept the
    allowable operators

For Tasks 1 & 2 => create new instance variables. These instance vars
need default values

Task 3
    Create/Override a toString method that will display
    {operand1} {operator} {operand2} = {result}

Task 4
    Create a Runner/Tester class: test all four constructors
    output the toString method after calling each constructor

Task 5
    Create a Player class
    attributes
        name: string between 3-10 chars
        strength: double: between 5 and 10
        health: double: between 30 and 50
    actions
        getAttacked(double value)
            decreased the health by the value
        isAlive
            determines if health is greater than 0
        toString to summarize: name, strength and health

    constructors: default (set all 3 attributes to a valid value)
                  1-String arg (set other 2 attributes to value values)
                  3-args (ensure all values are valid)
