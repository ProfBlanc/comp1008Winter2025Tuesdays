Task 1:
    Add a new constructor that allows user to
    add a minNumber amount and a maxnumber

    When user attempts to set Operand1 or 2
    enforce the operand value to only
    allow values between min and max

Task 2:
    Add a new constructor that accepts an array of chars
    will only allow user to answer those operators

    When user attempts to set operator, only accept the
    allowable operators

For Tasks 1 & 2 => create new instance variables. These instance vars
need default values

Task 3
    Create/Override a toString method that will display
    {operand1} {operator} {operand2} = {result}

Task 4
    Create a Runner/Tester class: test all four constructors
    output the toString method after calling each constructor
