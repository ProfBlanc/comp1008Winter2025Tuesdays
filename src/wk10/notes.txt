Entities that are created ONLY to be used 
as components

Abstract classes
Interface

Abstract: create a class whose purpose is to 
	  store common things of multiple classes

	-has same chars are concrete class
		constructors
		instance vars
		constants
	-does not have
		ability to be instantiated

	-CAN have abstract methods
		-method declared but not initialized 
			(has no method body)

	Shape
		area()
		perimeter()
	What is the default formula to calculate ANY shape?


create an abstract class named Shape3D or ThreeDShape	
	add instance variables
		height
		volume
	class should EXTEND Shape


You are starting a new company. This new company is a
payment processing company. Your business goal/plan
is to allow any STORE to USE your payment processing devices

Code this in Java
	1) Create an abstract class named PaymentProcessor
	pri	card: String: only accept 3 card types
	pri	price: double: 0+
	pri	type: purchase or refund
	pri	change: 0 or more
	pri	quantity: 1+
	pri	status: complete & incomplete
	
	constructor
	getters and setters
	abstract method named: getMarkup(): fee to add to every price (to cover cost of card payment
	
Create class called Store extend PaymentProcessor





What is an interface
	a component
		only has 
			constant values
			method declarations
	
	Okay....why would you use interface ISO abstract classes
	ANS: more limiting that abstract
	Use Case: if you want to create an entity that used
		  as a LIST OF REQUIREMENTS/ACTIONS

	Other note-worthy things
		a class can IMPLEMENT multiple interface
			???
				a class can only extend 1 other class
	
	I still don't get it.
	
	Calculator
		add
		substract
		multiply
		divide
		getResult 
	
	Dog/Pet
		speak
		eat
