Inheritance:
    Build a class based on another class
        Why? Take existing items and use them

FYI: already experience with inheritance
    Whaaat! Yes, because all classes are based on Object class


When should you use a inheritance
    Anytime there already a class but you want to ADD more items to this class
        General     =>      Specific
